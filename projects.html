      <p>
        a significant concern in the use of electric cars is the charging
        infrastructure. Many areas still lack sufficient charging stations,
        posing a challenge for widespread adoption. The issue becomes more
        severe as the popularity of electric cars continues to grow. However,
        this problem is being addressed through the development of smart roads
        that automatically charge vehicles.

      <h2>
        The Artificial Thermometer With RTD Sensor Controlled By Developed
        LabVIEW Program.

      <p>
        The central control will be facilitated by LabVIEW programming, serving
        as an intermediary for issuing commands, measuring, analyzing, and
        controlling the system. The system will utilize RTD/PT100 temperature
        sensor devices, and as these sensors start operating, data will be
        automatically transmitted back to the LabVIEW program.
